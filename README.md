A transmission-level framework for alignment, interception, and structural obstruction under irreversible action and motion.
## A Transmission-Level Structural Framework

**Status:** Structural placement  
**Category:** Transmission-level description  
**Claims:** Structural necessity only  
**Readouts:** Intentionally absent

## Abstract

This repository presents a transmission-level structural framework for describing alignment, obstruction, and continuity in contexts where:

- action is irreversible,
- global state is inaccessible,
- continuation cannot be suspended,
- and no agent or description may certify completeness, origin, or finality.

No axioms are added.  
No analytic methods are proposed.  
No origins or endpoints are assumed.  

The framework isolates **interception under motion** as a minimal structural requirement that allows continuity without closure, coordination without completeness, and action without certification.

All statements are **placement statements**, not solution claims.  
Nothing is resolved.  
Nothing is finalized.

## 1. Scope

This work operates strictly at the **transmission layer**.

It describes what must hold in any context where:

- irreversible commitments occur,
- prior commitments cannot be globally reversed,
- continuation persists,
- and no description has access to total state, total history, or total causality.

This is not a theory of systems.  
It is not a theory of agents.  
It is not a theory of truth.

It is a description of **what remains structurally possible** under these conditions.

---

## 2. Standing Conditions

Only the following conditions are assumed:

- **Continuation**  
  Transmission does not terminate.

- **Irreversibility**  
  Acts, once committed, cannot be undone.

- **Non-Certification**  
  No internal description may certify correctness, completeness, origin, or finality.

- **Inaccessibility of Global State**  
  No description has access to total system state, total history, or total causality.

No assumptions are made about:

- time,
- metrics,
- topology,
- probability,
- computation,
- origins,
- or endpoints.

---

## 3. Transmission and Campaign

**Transmission** refers to irreversible commitment under continuation.

**Campaign** is not a region, hierarchy, or system.  
It is an **orientation constraint**:

> Coherence must be preserved while reference points shift under motion.

Campaign does not resolve uncertainty.  
It prevents collapse while uncertainty persists.

---

## 4. Objects and Action Under Motion

Objects do not exist as fixed entities.

They exist only **as carried forward under action**.

Causal relevance is always **local and current**:

- causal attachment is reassigned by action,
- prior attachments do not persist,
- no attachment is global or terminal.

No claim is made about first acts.  
No claim is made about origins.  
No claim is made about whether there was one act or many.

Only this holds:

> Causal relevance is always relative to the most recent irreversible commitment  
> and is never globally certifiable.

---

## 5. Interception Under Motion

**Interception** is the minimal structural act that prevents collapse without resolving uncertainty.

Interception:

- adds no information,
- introduces no certification,
- does not resolve truth,
- does not stabilize permanently.

It holds continuity **at the moment continuity would otherwise fail**.

Interception does not stop motion.  
It allows motion to continue.

---

## 6. Reference, Alignment, and Multi-View Necessity

No single reference stance can maintain alignment under motion.

Alignment requires a minimal plurality of reference commitments such that:

- no single stance dominates,
- no pair can fully resolve ambiguity,
- orientation is preserved through reassignment.

The minimal structure requires **three anchor commitments**.

How these commitments are realized — sensory, symbolic, inferred — is not fixed.  
They are **sequentially related**, not temporally required.

This structure is minimal, not exhaustive.

---

## 7. Obstruction as Structural

Obstruction is not failure.  
Obstruction is not error.  
Obstruction is not breakdown.

Obstruction arises when:

- continuation persists,
- certification is attempted,
- and closure is presumed.

This is not pathological.  
It is a structural consequence of the standing conditions.

---

## 8. Totality (Placed)

Totality is neither assumed nor denied.

A totality question is admissible **only when**:

- it does not pre-empt the act that would give it meaning,
- it does not certify what cannot be certified,
- and it arises after irreversible commitments are already in place.

Outside this placement, totality questions generate obstruction.  
Within this placement, totality is allowed — but not yet accessible.

At present, that placement has not been reached.

---

## 9. Description, Updating, and Continuation

After an act, descriptions may update — or may not.

Updating is optional.  
Non-updating is allowed.  
Structural obstruction to updating is allowed.

None of these alter the carried object.  
They alter only relational alignment between descriptions.

Continuation does not require agreement.  
It requires only that action remain possible.

---

## 10. Riemann-Type Placement (Indicative)

Within this framework, Riemann-type questions are not treated as analytic statements about objects.

They are **alignment constraints under infinite transport**, where:

- no single reference stance may dominate,
- no premature certification is permitted,
- and continuation persists without closure.

Nothing is solved.  
Nothing is ruled out.

The question is placed.

---

## 11. What This Framework Does Not Do

- It does not define origins.
- It does not define systems.
- It does not define truth as an object.
- It does not certify outcomes.
- It does not terminate transmission.

---

## Closing

Nothing here fails.  
Nothing here succeeds.

Transmission continues.

Interception holds continuity where collapse would otherwise occur,  
without claiming resolution.

That is the structure described.
